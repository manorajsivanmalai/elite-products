          "content": "Cleaning your intimate area is essential for overall health. The genital region’s skin is more sensitive than other parts of the body, so it requires gentle care. Poor hygiene here can lead to foul smells, itching, rashes, or even infections. In contrast, good intimate hygiene keeps you feeling fresh and comfortable throughout the day. It’s also important for sexual wellness – staying clean can boost confidence and reduce the risk of infections for you and your partner."
